cryptomnesia

when damn near everything presents itself as familiar — it’s not a surprise that some of today’s most ambitious art is going about trying to make the familiar strange.
Inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced.
Old and new make the warp and woof of every moment. There is no thread that is not a twist of these two strands. By necessity, by proclivity, and by delight, we all quote. Neurological study has lately shown that memory, imagination, and consciousness itself is stitched, quilted, pastiched.
[lethem]

that the rights any thing should have are the same ones we believe we should have; that living things more like us are more important than those less like us; and that life itself is an existence of greater worth than inanimacy. These are understandable biases for us humans. We are mortal and fragile in specific ways, and we worry about them. [bogost]

Can we even imagine a speculative ethics? Could an object characterize the internal struggles and codes of another, simply by tracing and reconstructing evidence for such a code by the interactions of its neighbors? [bogost]

There is no particular mystery in animation… it's really very simple, and like anything that is simple, it is about the hardest thing in the world to do. [Bill Tytla at the Walt Disney Studio, June 28, 1937.] [lasseter]

[The form of a Happening] is open-ended and fluid; nothing obvious is sought and therefore nothing is won, except the certainty of a number of occurrences to which we are more than normally attentive.
artists' studios do not look like galleries and when an artists' studio does, everyone is suspicious.
we find ourselves running away or running to it, shocked and guilty either way.
that vast ennui, that anxiety lying so close to the surface of our comfortable existence
Chance, then, rather than spontaneity, is a key term, for it implies risk and fear (thus reestablishing that fine nervousness so pleasant when something is about to occur)


[kaprow]

Grace:
finding honor and credit through being
a deep human calling to know what's beyond being human
utter dependence upon a thing unseen
bringing the nothing forward
willingness to look at things other folks don't want to look at
ability to be present and grapple with the shit until it looks like something to anyone else
[gates]

not to be me, not to be like me, but to press out into the world my most ardent questions
[meredith hall]

And for every Harry Potter and Blair Witch project that explodes out of nowhere to capture the public's attention, there are thousands of books, movies, authors, and actors who live their entire inconspicuous lives beneath the featureless sea of noise that is modern popular culture [watts]

when does one hear music as coincidental sound, and when does one hear sound as music?
the city's roaring tonight
listening is about the decision to do it, rather than talk about it
[westerkamp]

forgetting is essential to action of any kind [nietszche]

new world order of blankness
neutrality breeds suspicion
[michael connor]

in search of lost time [proust]

affect is the capacity to affect or be affected
affect is a lived abstraction
affect is what's left of potential after lived immediate experience
non-conscious stirrings
a change in focus, a rustle at the edges of peripheral vision that draws the gaze to it
autonomy of affect is the process of remaindering potentials that are in excess of lived immediate experience
bodies think as they feel
the present is lost with the missing half-second, passing too quickly to be perceived, too quickly, actually, to have happened.
art is the royal road to the unactualized
[massumi]

Taken in the broadest sense, any apprehension of something doing, is an experience of activity
[william james]

the dramatic "um…"
mock uncertainty hiding real uncertainty
disempower the question "what have you got to say"
unwilling suspension of disbelief
pleasure of our own self-deception
[kentridge]

he came to resemble himself, the worst thing that can happen to anyone.
writers and olympic swimmers are exactly the same, except olympic swimmers don't feel like they're drowning every time they jump in the pool.

[vitiello]

From within the antumbra, the Sun appears larger than the Moon which is seen in complete silhouette. [nasa]

a "sculpture" that physically reacts to its environment is no longer to be regarded as an object. The range of outside factors affecting it, as well as its own radius of action, reach beyond the space it materially occupies. It thus merges with the environment in a relationship that is better understood as a "system" of interdependent processes. These processes evolve without the viewer's empathy. He becomes a witness. A system is not imagined, it is real. [Haacke]

imagine if chewbacca swallowed like eighty liters of codeine or dimetapp… and sing like that. [Hecker]

harmonic seduction that you bestow upon yourself [Hecker]

sound causes the object to make themselves known
god knows what the mathematics of an octave are
in 1965, forty minutes was a long time
you're not going to change your ideas. that's the worst thing you can do. so there.
[Lucier]

repetition is a beautiful vehicle [attias]

How can he remember well his ignorance – which his growth requires – who has so often to use his knowledge?
As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.
We may waive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere.
No dust gathers on the grass, unless where man has broken ground.
[thoreau]

"KILLING TIME!" roared the dog – so furiously that his alarm went off. "It's bad enough wasting time without killing it." And he shuddered at the thought.

cognition is beautiful. it's beautiful to know.
[john hull, notes on blindness]

It is an experience of being in a world where the difference between light and darkness has become completely irrelevant.
Why is thunder like scratching?
feelings so deep that you can’t feel them.
I can stretch out my fingers and feel your closed eyelids, the ball of your eye. But the feel of the eye is nothing like eye contact, is it?
[john hull, sound: an enrichment or state]

i defy m. Vaucanson and all the machinists on earth to make an artificial face that expresses the passions, because to express the passions of the soul, one must have a soul
[critic of vaucanson]

certainly those unborn ghosts include poets greater than Keats, scientists greater than Newton, but in the teeth of those stupefying odds, it is you, and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.
[dawkins]

at the end of daybreak, this inert town with its beyond of lepers, of consumption, of famines, of fears crouched in the ravines, fears perched in the trees, fears dug in the ground, fears adrift in the sky, of piled up fears and their fumaroles of anguish

there's a ghost under my table
reading freud

fall into the cloud
that hangs outside your window
like the anchor of a shipwreck

i was younger than i am
you were younger than i was

skip, glowing, hundreds of feet above boiling molten cotton and
waltz through the void corridor
hear the meteors ring like dimes in wine glasses
as they cascade far above

naked skeleton maple, for all the world

the only thing for sand to fall in love with is the wind

rain crackles through trees

anything can happen once [make the once]

twenty four hours later

this is the procedure

throw your tools in the fire

i don't want to be the 99%

more efficient for large movies

persistent phantom pain serves to disconnect the hemispheres

what is calming about the ocean?

watching the backlit wind turn sand into spray, scouring the beach into perfect tiny dunes. out of nowhere, i had this wash of feeling like everything was connected, everything made sense in terms of waves – the white noise of the wind, the repetitive asynchronous slap of the waves, the impact of my footsteps, the refracting shades of yellow light in the blowing sand, the peaks and valleys of the mini-dunes in the foreground with their bigger, older relatives reaching into the fog in the background – it all felt suddenly like one thing.




you know what's cool?
i'll tell you anyway, even though i can tell you're humoring me:

if you sit on this side of the balcony, here,
no - you have to actually come here -
if you sit here, and look down the coast

everything that's close stays just as it is.

but because of all the haze,
almost blinding so early in the morning,
mountains, cities, trees, all of it -
everything turns into sky in the distance.

you say "that's beautiful, you should write it down"
and i'm pretty sure you're already gone.



real old – not vintage. the kind of old that's all scrubbed and meticulous because it doesn't need the extra layer of dust to justify it

[zizek]

I hate dangling things; I hate dampish things. I hate wandering and mixing things together.
The dew dancing on the tips of the flowers and the leaves made the garden a mosaic of single sparks not yet formed into a whole.

Cambridge if sometimes in its box of

Spring is like a perhaps hand

who pays any attention

And death i think is no parenthesis

there is a lady, whose name is Afterwards
she is sitting beside young death, is slender;
likes flowers

This is, um, Sam's grow tape, aaaand, you're now eight, Sam, so, I don't know, could you tell us something about being eight? How does it feel to be eight?

I dunno

How is it different from being seven?

Uh, not different at all

Not different at all?

Doesn't feel like it, anyway

what about things that you can do? Things that, you know, you… like computer things you can do that you didn't use to be able to do?

Um. I dunno, like, I'm a little bit better at computer, but I was pretty good at computer when I was seven.

So, Sam, here you are at dinner, on one of your many travels. Are you enjoying your dessert, Sam? Your illicit dessert when you're supposed to be sleeping? Looks like it.
	He's full of sleep.
He's full of sleep – you mean he's had enough?
	No
		No, he's halfway out
So maybe he thinks this is all a dream – a wonderful dream.
		Hah, that's right. Ask *him!*
Sam, are you having fun?
	He's absorbed by something

Oh, is that how silly you want to be?
	Uh huh!
Okay. Um, can I interview–
	–what?
Can I interview you a little bit?
	What does innnerview mean?
That means I ask you questions and you answer them, like… um, "okay, Sarah, what are your favorite colors?"
	All the colors.
All the colors?
	But not black and brown.
Why?
	Because they're boring… (giggle)
Oh ho! …Is that something like what your brother said when he was on the tape–
	(giggle)
–and you watched that tape recently, and you thought you were so much like him, you couldn't believe it?
	(giggle)
Is that sort of what's going on?
	Uh huh… (giggle)
Yeah. Can I ask you another question?
	Yeah.
Um, at this point in your life, what do you think you might like to be when you grow up?
	An infant teacher.
An infant teacher? And which school do you think you'd like to work at–
	–(singing) haaaapppy dayyyyyys
And which school do you think you'd like to work at?
	Radcliffe Child Care Center.
Is that the school that you go to?
	Yeah.
Yeah.

You're trying new territory. Are you trying new territory? Are you trying new territory, Sammy? Hey, Sammy! Hello, Sam. Hey there, Sam, Hello there. Sam. Hello sam. Hello Sam-u-el. What's doin, Sam? What's doin on the Rialto?

He's so alert. Yes!
	Sam! Look, he wants to know where the voice is coming, I told you! He is very clever. Oh my.
He doesn't miss anything.

I'm just going to do a quick…
	Take your hands away from his face, Marion.
		Does that register voices too?
Yes
		Oh, that's – I'll start talking then. How've you been, baby? Sammy, how are you? Hello, Sammy!
Sam, how do you feel on the eve of your fifth month birthday? It's a big event!
